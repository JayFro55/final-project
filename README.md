I would like to grab weather and forecast information for different locations.
It would grab weather information for different locations: possibly parks.
Similar to how a ski resort will grab weather information on their sites to alert 
customers to incoming weather for planned trips.
I want to build this to have easy access to help plan special or everyday trips.
All of my frequently traveled to locations will be easily accessible which will 
allow me to plan accordingly.
I will use a free weather API: potentially the Yahoo weather API.
